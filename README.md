Deep Learning of Hydrological Rating Curves


Research Question: How can we develop an accurate and reliable model to predict hydrological rating curves for locations without data collection points using ML and deep learning techniques?

The Artificial Intelligence for Water Forecasting program is a collaborative effort sponsored by the UA Strategic Graduate Partnerships Initiative (SGPI), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH), and the Institute of Data Analytics (IDA).

Hydrological rating curves are essential tools in hydrology, providing a relationship between the water level and the flow rate of a river or stream at a particular location. For this project, we are made available with 7000 data collection points in the United States for existing rating curves. I am working on a python program using ML and deep learning to be able to predict these rating curves at places where there isnâ€™t a collection point.

Objectives  
1.	Develop an ML and deep learning-based model to predict hydrological rating curves.
2.	Validate the model using existing data collection points.
3.	Assess the model's performance and reliability in predicting rating curves at unmonitored locations.

Research Challenges
This project addresses several key challenges:
1.	Data Quality and Availability: Ensuring the quality and completeness of the data from 7000 collection points.
2.	Model Complexity: Developing a robust model that can handle the variability in hydrological data and predict accurate rating curves.
3.	Geographical Variability: Accounting for geographical and environmental factors that influence the rating curves.
4.	Model Generalization: Ensuring that the model generalizes well to new, unseen locations without data collection points.

Research Approach
To address the research question, the following approach will be taken:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess data from 7000 existing collection points. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the data for model training.
2.	Feature Engineering: Identify and engineer relevant parts of the data that influence the rating curves, such as river geometry, flow rate, and water level.
3.	Model Development: Develop and train various ML and deep learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to predict the rating curves.
4.	Model Validation: Validate the models using a subset of the data and evaluate their performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. Use some other metrics that are widely used in hydrology, such as Nash Sucliffe efficiency and Kling Gupta efficiency (Recommended by Andres Ramirez)
5.	Model Testing and Deployment: Test the models on unseen locations and refine them based on performance. Deploy the best-performing model for practical use.

Anticipated Outcomes:
Through this approach, we expect to:
1.	Develop a reliable model capable of predicting hydrological rating curves for locations without data collection points.
2.	Enhance our understanding of the factors influencing rating curves and their geographical variability.
3.	Provide a valuable tool for hydrologists and water resource managers to estimate flow rates and manage water resources more effectively.
